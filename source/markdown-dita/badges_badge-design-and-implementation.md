# Badge design components

Logic and planning problems of this sort are best approached visually. Design exercises such as card sorting or affinitization depend upon multiple team members seeing all the variables and iteratively testing various arrangements or groupings. Similarly, making a first, complete pass at designing all the content badges that you might need will accelerate the process of developing and refining the logic of your badging. If you have time to code the badges in a DITA library, that's great -- but sticky notes or 3x5 cards will suffice for team discussions early on. Move the cards around. Tape them to whiteboards. Staple them to printouts of your existing docs. Any exercise that simulates you applying a badge to your content and then asking whether that makes sense is goodness.

Although there are multiple ways to implement content badging in DITA, the badges themselves share  some common building blocks:
